Send Contact Form 7 submission & WooCommerce order data to other 30+ platforms.

== DESCRIPTION ==

Connect Contact Form 7 & WooCommerce to 30+ other platforms. It works like when a form is submitted to your website, the plugin will automatically create a new row in Google Sheets, subscribe to a mailing list in Sendinblue, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, etc. Similarly, it allows to send WooCommerce order data.

* **Easy to use**: The plugin was created, keeping not-tech people in mind. New integrations can be set up in a few minutes. No coding skill is required, almost no learning curve.

* **Flexible**: Integrations can be created from any sender platform to any receiver platform. You can create as many connections as you want—single sender to multiple receivers, multiple senders to a single receiver, multiple senders to multiple receivers. Just keep in mind that all PHP server has a maximum execution time allowed.

* **Conditional Logic**: You can create single or multiple conditional logic to filter the data flow. Submitted data will only be sent if the conditions match. For example, when you want to send contact data only if the user has agreed and filed the checkbox "I agree" (Contact Form 7 acceptance field) or if the city is only New York or the subject contacts the word "Lead," etc. You can set up the conditions as you like.

* **Special Tags**: We have introduced several special tags that can be passed to receiver platforms. These are helpful when you want some more information that the user submitted, like IP address, user agent, etc. Example: `{{_date}}` same format and timezone that is saved in WordPress settings, `{{_time}}` same format and timezone that is saved in WordPress settings, `{{_weekday}}` weekday like Monday, Tuesday, etc., `{{_user_ip}}`, `{{_user_agent}}`, `{{_site_title}}`, `{{_site_description}}`, `{{_site_url}}`, `{{_site_admin_email}}`, `{{_post_id}}`, `{{_post_name}}`, `{{_post_title}}`, `{{_post_url}}`, `{{_user_id}}`, `{{_user_first_name}}`, `{{_user_last_name}}`, `{{_user_last_name}}`, `{{_user_email}}`.

* **Multisite**: Multisite supported.

### SENDER PLATFORMS (TRIGGER) ###

The following plugins work as a sender platform.

*  **[Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)**: Any contact form created using Contact Form 7 can be integrated. So when a user submits the form, data will be sent to connected platforms.

*  **[WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)**: When a new order is placed or order status is processing/on-hold/completed/failed/pending/refunded/canceled in a WooCommerce shop, the order data can be sent to connected platforms. The following are the regular fields that the plugin allows to send by default: Order ID, Parent ID, User ID, Billing First Name, Billing Last Name, Formatted Billing Full Name, Billing Company, Billing Address 1, Billing Address 2, Billing City, Billing State, Billing Postcode, Billing Country, Billing Email, Billing Phone, Formatted Billing Address, Shipping First Name, Shipping Last Name, Shipping Full Name, Shipping Company, Shipping Address 1, Shipping Address 2, Shipping City, Shipping State, Shipping Postcode, Shipping Country, Shipping Email, Shipping Phone, Formatted Shipping Address, Shipping Address Map URL, Payment Method, Payment Method Title, Transaction ID, Order Created Via, Date Completed, Date Created, Date Modified, Date Paid, Cart Hash, Currency, Customer ID, Customer IP Address, Customer User Agent, Customer Note, Total, Formatted Order Total, Order Item Total, Prices Include Tax, Discount Total, Discount Tax, Shipping Total, Shipping Tax, Cart Tax, Total Tax, Total Discount, Subtotal, Tax Totals, Items Full JSON, Line Item(s) ID, Line Item(s) Name, Line Item(s) SKU, Line Item(s) Variation ID, Line Item(s) Quantity, Line Item(s) Total, Line Item(s) Price, Line Item(s) Sale Price, Line Item(s) Regular Price, Line Item(s) Subtotal, Line Item(s) Subtotal Tax, Line Item(s) Subtotal With Tax, Line Item(s) Total Tax, Line Item(s) Total With Tax, Line Item(s) Number In Cart, Line Item(s) Attributes, Taxes, Shipping Methods, Shipping Method, Coupons Applied and Coupons Amount Total.

 In addition to regular fields, you can also use WooCommerce custom order fields. For example, to send fields created by the [Checkout Field Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-checkout-field-editor-pro/) plugin,  you have to add the input field name value manually as a tag. For example, in the checkout page, you’ve added an extra field for Interests and its name value is “interests”, then add a tag {{interests}} while creating the integration. The plugin should parse the value from user input and send it to the connected platform field.

### WHY I CREATED THIS PLUGIN ###

*I was using a popular form plugin on my website for new registrations. I built several integrations with CRM, email marketing soft, Google Sheets, etc. The form had add-ons for those. Then I found another form with more features but less expensive, so I decided to migrate. Here comes the challenge. The new form didn't have native add-ons to integrate all the platforms I was using. So I created a few of my own and thought it could help others If I can create a universal plugin that connects all popular forms and 3rd party platforms. This plugin is built to add new sender and receiver platforms, so the opportunity has no bound. I'm adding new platforms regularly. Currently, Contact Form 7 and WooCommerce are supported free and need a pro license for others.*
